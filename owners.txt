; this is an example owners.txt file which can be added at any level in the repo to indicate owners of a subtree
; this file is used by ownership enforcer (OE) to determine reviewers to add to a pull request
; you can add comments using ; as prefix
; introduce each owner in a separate line with his/her alias (not email address)
; prefixing an alias with * means that the owner will not be automatically added as a reviewer to pull requests to reduce noise, but can still be manually added and can sign off if necessary
; prefixing an alias with @ means "alert only" - this alias is not an owner (approval won't affect OE) but will be added to pull requests in order to be notifiedâ€‹

; if you do not wish to use this feature then you can delete this file
; example (pretend the following lines are not commented):
;
; developer1
; developer2
; *developer3
; * means "no spam" - this alias will not automatically be added as a reviewer to pull requests, to reduce notification noise
; (this alias still has approval privileges just like any other code owner)
; @developer4
; @ means "alert only" - this alias is not an owner (approval won't affect OE) but will be added to pull requests in order to be notified
