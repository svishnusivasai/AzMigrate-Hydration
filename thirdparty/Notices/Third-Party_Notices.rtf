\par
Preamble\par
\par
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\par
\~\par
Definitions:\par
\par
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\par
\par
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the\line package.\par
\par
\ldblquote You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\par
\par
\ldblquote Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing\line community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\par
\par
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\par
\par
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\par
\par
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\par
\par
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\par

\par

\pard\widctlpar\fi-360\li720 a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. \par
\par
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\par
\par
c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. \par
\par
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\par

\pard\widctlpar\par
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\par
\par
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\par
\par
7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.\par

\lang1033\par
\lang9 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\par
\line (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\par
\line (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under\line (i) the Original License or\line (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\par

\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version.

If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par

\lang9 Aggregating or Linking the Package\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\b\lang9 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\b0\lang1033\par
\b\lang9\~\b0\lang1033\par
\lang9 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\lang1033\par
\b\lang9\~\b0\lang1033\par
\b\lang9 General Provisions\b0\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\lang1033\par

\par
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\par
\par

\lang9 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\par
\line (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\par
\line (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under\line (i) the Original License or\line (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\par

Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success stories.\par

The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development of open-source software as part of the open-source software community. Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, indirect and consequential damages.\par
\par
DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\lang9 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 Preamble\lang1033\par
\lang9 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 Definitions\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\lang1033\par
\b\lang9\~\b0\lang1033\par
\b\lang9 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\b0\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\lang1033\par
\lang9 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\b\lang9 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\b0\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\par
\lang1033\par
\lang9 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\par
\line (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\par
\line (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under\line (i) the Original License or\line (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\par
\line Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.\lang1033\par
\lang9 Aggregating or Linking the Package\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\b\lang9 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\b0\lang1033\par
\b\lang9\~\b0\lang1033\par
\lang9 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\lang1033\par
\b\lang9\~\b0\lang1033\par
\b\lang9 General Provisions\b0\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\lang1033\par
\lang9\~\lang1033\par
\lang9 (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\lang1033\par

   source, and configuration files.\par
\par
   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\par
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\par
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\par
   and conversions to other media types.\par
\par
   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\par
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\par
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\par
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\par
\par
   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\par
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\par
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\par
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\par
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\par
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\par
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\par
\par
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\par
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\par
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\par

   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\par
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\par

   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\par
\par
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\par
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\par
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.\par
\par
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\par
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\par
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\par
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\par
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\par
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\par
\par
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\par
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\par
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\par
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\par
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\par

   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\par
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\par
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\par
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\par
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\par
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\par
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\par
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\par
   as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\par
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\par
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\par
   meet the following conditions:\par
\par
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\par
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\par
\par
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\par
       stating that You changed the files; and\par
\par
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\par
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\par
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\par
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\par
       the Derivative Works; and\par
\par
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\par
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\par
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\par
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\par
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\par
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\par
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\par
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\par
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\par
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\par
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\par
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\par
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\par
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\par
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\par
       as modifying the License.\par
\par
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\par
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\par
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\par
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\par
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\par
   the conditions stated in this License.\par
\par
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\par
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\par
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\par
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\par
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\par
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\par
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\par
\par
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\par
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\par
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\par
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\par
\par
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\par
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\par
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\par
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\par
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\par
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\par
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\par
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\par
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\par
\par
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\par
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\par
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\par
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\par
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\par
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\par
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\par
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\par
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\par
\par
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\par
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\par
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\par
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\par
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\par
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\par
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\par
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\par
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\par
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\par

Definitions.\line\line\~ "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\line\line\~ "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\line works, such as semiconductor masks.\line\line\~ "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\line License.\~ Each licensee is addressed as "you".\~ "Licensees" and\line "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\line\line\~ To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\line in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\line exact copy.\~ The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\line earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\line\line\~ A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\line on the Program.\line\line\~ To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\line permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\line infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\line computer or modifying a private copy.\~ Propagation includes copying,\line distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\line public, and in some countries other activities as well.\line\line\~ To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\line parties to make or receive copies.\~ Mere interaction with a user through\line a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\line\line\~ An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\line to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\line feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\line tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\line extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\line work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\~ If\line the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\line menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\line\line\~ 1. Source Code.\line\line\~ The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\line for making modifications to it.\~ "Object code" means any non-source\line form of a work.\line\line\~ A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\line standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\line interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\line is widely used among developers working in that language.\line\line\~ The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\line than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\line packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\line Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\line Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\line implementation is available to the public in source code form.\~ A\line "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\line (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\line (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\line produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\line\line\~ The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\line the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\line work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\line control those activities.\~ However, it does not include the work's\line System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\line programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\line which are not part of the work.\~ For example, Corresponding Source\line includes interface definition files associated with source files for\line the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\line linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\line such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\line subprograms and other parts of the work.\line\line\~ The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\line can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\line Source.\line\line\~ The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\line same work.\line\line\~ 2. Basic Permissions.\line\line\~ All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\line copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\line conditions are met.\~ This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\line permission to run the unmodified Program.\~ The output from running a\line covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\line content, constitutes a covered work.\~ This License acknowledges your\line rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\line\line\~ You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\line convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\line in force.\~ You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\line of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\line with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\line the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\line not control copyright.\~ Those thus making or running the covered works\line for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\line and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\line your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\line\line\~ Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\line the conditions stated below.\~ Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\line makes it unnecessary.\line\line\~ 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\line\line\~ No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\line measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\line 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\line similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\line measures.\line\line\~ When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\line circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\line is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\line the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\line modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\line users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\line technological measures.\line\line\~ 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\line\line\~ You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\line receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\line appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\line keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\line non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\line keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\line recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\line\line\~ You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\line and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\line\line\~ 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\line\line\~ You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\line produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\line terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line\~\~\~ a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\line\~\~\~ it, and giving a relevant date.\line\line\~\~\~ b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\line\~\~\~ released under this License and any conditions added under section\line\~\~\~ 7.\~ This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\line\~\~\~ "keep intact all notices".\line\line\~\~\~ c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\line\~\~\~ License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.\~ This\line\~\~\~ License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\line\~\~\~ additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\line\~\~\~ regardless of how they are packaged.\~ This License gives no\line\~\~\~ permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\line\~\~\~ invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\line\line\~\~\~ d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\line\~\~\~ Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\line\~\~\~ interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\line\~\~\~ work need not make them do so.\line\line\~ A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\line works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\line and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\line in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\line "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\line used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\line beyond what the individual works permit.\~ Inclusion of a covered work\line in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\line parts of the aggregate.\line\line\~ 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\line\line\~ You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\line of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\line machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\line in one of these ways:\line\line\~\~\~ a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line\~\~\~ (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\line\~\~\~ Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\line\~\~\~ customarily used for software interchange.\line\line\~\~\~ b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line\~\~\~ (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\line\~\~\~ written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\line\~\~\~ long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\line\~\~\~ model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\line\~\~\~ copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\line\~\~\~ product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\line\~\~\~ medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\line\~\~\~ more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\line\~\~\~ conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\line\~\~\~ Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\line\line\~\~\~ c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\line\~\~\~ written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.\~ This\line\~\~\~ alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\line\~\~\~ only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\line\~\~\~ with subsection 6b.\line\line\~\~\~ d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\line\~\~\~ place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\line\~\~\~ Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\line\~\~\~ further charge.\~ You need not require recipients to copy the\line\~\~\~ Corresponding Source along with the object code.\~ If the place to\line\~\~\~ copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\line\~\~\~ may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\line\~\~\~ that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\line\~\~\~ clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\line\~\~\~ Corresponding Source.\~ Regardless of what server hosts the\line\~\~\~ Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\line\~\~\~ available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\line\line\~\~\~ e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\line\~\~\~ you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\line\~\~\~ Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\line\~\~\~ charge under subsection 6d.\line\line\~ A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\line from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\line included in conveying the object code work.\line\line\~ A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\line tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\line or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\line into a dwelling.\~ In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\line doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.\~ For a particular\line product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\line typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\line of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\line actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.\~ A product\line is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\line commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\line the only significant mode of use of the product.\line\line\~ "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\line procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\line and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\line a modified version of its Corresponding Source.\~ The information must\line suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\line code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\line modification has been made.\line\line\~ If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\line specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\line part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\line User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\line fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\line Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\line by the Installation Information.\~ But this requirement does not apply\line if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\line modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\line been installed in ROM).\line\line\~ The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\line requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\line for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\line the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.\~ Access to a\line network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\line adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\line protocols for communication across the network.\line\line\~ Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\line in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\line documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\line source code form), and must require no special password or key for\line unpacking, reading or copying.\line\line\~ 7. Additional Terms.\line\line\~ "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\line License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\line Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\line be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\line that they are valid under applicable law.\~ If additional permissions\line apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\line under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\line this License without regard to the additional permissions.\line\line\~ When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\line remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\line it.\~ (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\line removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)\~ You may place\line additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\line for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\line\line\~ Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\line add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\line that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\line\line\~\~\~ a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\line\~\~\~ terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\line\line\~\~\~ b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\line\~\~\~ author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\line\~\~\~ Notices displayed by works containing it; or\line\line\~\~\~ c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\line\~\~\~ requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\line\~\~\~ reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\line\line\~\~\~ d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\line\~\~\~ authors of the material; or\line\line\~\~\~ e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\line\~\~\~ trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\line\line\~\~\~ f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\line\~\~\~ material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\line\~\~\~ it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\line\~\~\~ any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\line\~\~\~ those licensors and authors.\line\line\~ All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\line restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.\~ If the Program as you\line received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\line governed by this License along with a term that is a further\line restriction, you may remove that term.\~ If a license document contains\line a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\line License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\line of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\line not survive such relicensing or conveying.\line\line\~ If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\line must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\line additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\line where to find the applicable terms.\line\line\~ Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\line form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\line the above requirements apply either way.\line\line\~ 8. Termination.\line\line\~ You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\line provided under this License.\~ Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\line modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\line this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\line paragraph of section 11).\line\line\~ However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\line license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\line provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\line finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\line holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\line prior to 60 days after the cessation.\line\line\~ Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\line reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\line violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\line received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\line copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\line your receipt of the notice.\line\line\~ Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\line licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\line this License.\~ If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\line reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\line material under section 10.\line\line\~ 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\line\line\~ You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\line run a copy of the Program.\~ Ancillary propagation of a covered work\line occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\line to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.\~ However,\line nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\line modify any covered work.\~ These actions infringe copyright if you do\line not accept this License.\~ Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\line covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\line\line\~ 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\line\line\~ Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\line receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\line propagate that work, subject to this License.\~ You are not responsible\line for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\line\line\~ An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\line organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\line organization, or merging organizations.\~ If propagation of a covered\line work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\line transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\line licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\line give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\line Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\line the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\line\line\~ You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\line rights granted or affirmed under this License.\~ For example, you may\line not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\line rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\line (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\line any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\line sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\line\line\~ 11. Patents.\line\line\~ A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\line License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.\~ The\line work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\line\line\~ A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\line owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\line hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\line by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\line but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\line consequence of further modification of the contributor version.\~ For\line purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\line patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\line this License.\line\line\~ Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\line patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\line make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\line propagate the contents of its contributor version.\line\line\~ In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\line agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\line (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\line sue for patent infringement).\~ To "grant" such a patent license to a\line party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\line patent against the party.\line\line\~ If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\line and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\line to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\line publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\line then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\line available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\line patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\line consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\line license to downstream recipients.\~ "Knowingly relying" means you have\line actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\line covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\line in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\line country that you have reason to believe are valid.\line\line\~ If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\line arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\line covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\line receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\line or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\line you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\line work and works based on it.\line\line\~ A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\line the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\line conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\line specifically granted under this License.\~ You may not convey a covered\line work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\line in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\line to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\line the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\line parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\line patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\line conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\line for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\line contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\line or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\line\line\~ Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\line any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\line otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\line\line\~ 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\line\line\~ If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.\~ If you cannot convey a\line covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\line not convey it at all.\~ For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\line to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\line the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\line License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\line\line\~ 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\line\line\~ Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\line permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\line under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\line combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\~ The terms of this\line License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\line but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\line section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\line combination as such.\line\line\~ 14. Revised Versions of this License.\line\line\~ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\line the GNU General Public License from time to time.\~ Such new versions will\line be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line address new problems or concerns.\line\line\~ Each version is given a distinguishing version number.\~ If the\line Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\line Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\line option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\line version or of any later version published by the Free Software\line Foundation.\~ If the Program does not specify a version number of the\line GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\line by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line\~ If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\line versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\line public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\line to choose that version for the Program.\line\line\~ Later license versions may give you additional or different\line permissions.\~ However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\line author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\line later version.\line\~15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\line\line\~ THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\line APPLICABLE LAW.\~ EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\line HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\line OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\line THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.\~ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\line IS WITH YOU.\~ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\line ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line\~ 16. Limitation of Liability.\line\line\~ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\line THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\line GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\line USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\line DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\line PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\line EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\line SUCH DAMAGES.\line\line\~ 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\line\line\~ If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\line above cannot be given local leg\par

\pard\widctlpar\line\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Version 2, June 1991\line\line Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\line 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\line Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Preamble\line\line\~ The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.\~ By contrast, the GNU General Public\line License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\line software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\~ This\line General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\line Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\line using it.\~ (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\line the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)\~ You can apply it to\line your programs, too.\line\line\~ When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.\~ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line\~ To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\line distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line\line\~ For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\line you have.\~ You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\line source code.\~ And you must show them these terms so they know their\line rights.\line\line\~ We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\line (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\line distribute and/or modify the software.\line\line\~ Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line software.\~ If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\line that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\line authors' reputations.\line\line\~ Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.\~ We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\line program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\line program proprietary.\~ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\line patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\line\line\~ The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\line\line\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line\~\~ TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line\~ 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\line a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\line under the terms of this General Public License.\~ The "Program", below,\line refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\line means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\line that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\line either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\line language.\~ (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\line the term "modification".)\~ Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\~ The act of\line running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\line is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\line Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\line Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line\line\~ 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\line source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\line conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\line copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\line notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\line and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\line along with the Program.\line\line You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\line you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line\line\~ 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line\~\~\~ a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\line\~\~\~ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line\~\~\~ b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\line\~\~\~ whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\line\~\~\~ part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\line\~\~\~ parties under the terms of this License.\line\line\~\~\~ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\line\~\~\~ when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\line\~\~\~ interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\line\~\~\~ announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\line\~\~\~ notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\line\~\~\~ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\line\~\~\~ these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\line\~\~\~ License.\~ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\line\~\~\~ does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\line\~\~\~ the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\~ If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.\~ But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Program.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line\~ 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\line under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\line Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line\line\~\~\~ a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\line\~\~\~ source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\line\~\~\~ 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line\~\~\~ b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\line\~\~\~ years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\line\~\~\~ cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\line\~\~\~ machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\line\~\~\~ distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\line\~\~\~ customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line\~\~\~ c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\line\~\~\~ to distribute corresponding source code.\~ (This alternative is\line\~\~\~ allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\line\~\~\~ received the program in object code or executable form with such\line\~\~\~ an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line\line The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.\~ For an executable work, complete source\line code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\line associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\line control compilation and installation of the executable.\~ However, as a\line special exception, the source code distributed need not include\line anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\line form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\line operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\line itself accompanies the executable.\line\line If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\line access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\line access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\line distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line\~ 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line except as expressly provided under this License.\~ Any attempt\line otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line parties remain in full compliance.\line\line\~ 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.\~ However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Program or its derivative works.\~ These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\~ Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Program or works based on it.\line\line\~ 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line these terms and conditions.\~ You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\line\~ 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.\~ If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Program at all.\~ For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line implemented by public license practices.\~ Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line\~ 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.\~ In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line\~ 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the General Public License from time to time.\~ Such new versions will\line be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.\~ If the Program\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line Software Foundation.\~ If the Program does not specify a version number of\line this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line Foundation.\line\line\~ 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line to ask for permission.\~ For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line make exceptions for this.\~ Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line\line\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ NO WARRANTY\line\line\~ 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\line FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\~ EXCEPT WHEN\line OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\line PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\~ THE ENTIRE RISK AS\line TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\~ SHOULD THE\line PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\line REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line\~ 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\line REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\line INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\line OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\line TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\line YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\line PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\line POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line\line\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\line\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line\line\~ If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\line free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line\line\~ To do so, attach the following notices to the program.\~ It is safest\line to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\line the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line\~\~\~ \line\~\~\~ Copyright (C) \~ \line\line\~\~\~ This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\line\~\~\~ it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\line\~\~\~ the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\line\~\~\~ (at your option) any later version.\line\line\~\~\~ This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line\~\~\~ but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line\~\~\~ MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\~ See the\line\~\~\~ GNU General Public License for more details.\line\line\~\~\~ You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\line\~\~\~ with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\line\~\~\~ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\cf0\b\par
