PREREQUISITES

    Windows

        This module is only applicable on "native" (i.e. non-Cygwin) Microsoft
        Windows platforms since only those platforms have C run-time libraries
        suffering the behaviour to which this module provides corrections.

    Compiler

        You need a C compiler to build this module.

        Note that you should try to use the same compiler as was used to build
        your Perl itself.

        In particular, this module may not work correctly if it loads a
        different C run-time DLL to that loaded by perl itself.  Note that
        Visual Studio 98 (VC++ 6) and earlier produce binaries that require the
        system's msvcrt.dll, while Visual Studio .NET/2003 (VC++ 7), Visual
        Studio 2005 (VC++ 8) and later (including the free Visual C++ Toolkit
        2003 and the free Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition) produce binaries that
        require compiler-specific DLLs named msvcr70.dll, msvcr71.dll,
        msvcr80.dll etc.  Therefore, building this module with anything later
        than Visual Studio 98 for use with any ActivePerl, which are known
        currently to be built with Visual Studio 98, may not work.

        The Makefile.PL script will try to detect if a different compiler is
        being used and will give a warning if necessary.  Note, however, that it
        is not always possible for it to detect which particular compiler
        version was used to build Perl, especially for Perl version 5.8.6 or
        older, which did not have this information stored in the standard
        library module Config.

    Perl

        Perl version 5.6.0 or later.
        The latest version of Perl is available from http://www.perl.com/.

    Perl Modules

        There are no non-standard Perl modules required by this module.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL file
    and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

    Use "dmake" rather than "nmake" in the commands above if that is what your
    Perl was built with.  To determine which make program was used to build your
    Perl type the following:

        perl -V:make
